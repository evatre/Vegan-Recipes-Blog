      <h2>Vegan or Plant based?</h2>
      <p>
        The plant-based movement began with veganism, a way of living that aims
        to avoid animal harm for ethical reasons. It has expanded to include
        people who make dietary and lifestyle choices to minimize harm to the
        environment and their health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although a number of definitions are circulating, most people agree upon
        some specific differences between the terms “plant-based” and “vegan.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Being plant-based typically refers specifically to one’s diet alone.
        Many people use the term “plant-based” to indicate that they eat a diet
        that either entirely or mostly comprises plant foods. However, some
        people may call themselves plant-based and still eat certain
        animal-derived products.
